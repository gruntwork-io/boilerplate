# Deploy a Production-grade VPC

## What is a VPC?

If you were building your own data center, you would set up a physical network by
configuring switches, routers, connecting everything with ethernet cables, and so
on. In the AWS cloud, you can set up a virtual network (AKA a software-defined
network) by configuring a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Each VPC defines a logical
partition of your AWS account, complete with its own IP addresses, subnets,
routing rules, and firewalls.

The VPC serves three primary purposes:

* **Networking**:
  The VPC is the basic networking and communication layer for your AWS account.
  Just about every AWS resource (e.g., EC2 instances, RDS databases, ELBs, etc)
  runs in a VPC and the VPC determines how (or if) all those resources are able
  to talk to each other.

* **Security**:
  The VPC is also the basic security layer for your AWS account. As it controls
  all networking and communication, itâ€™s your first line of defense against
  attackers, protecting your resources from unwanted access.

* **Partitioning**:
  VPCs also give you a way to create separate, logical partitions within an AWS
  account. For example, you could have one VPC for a staging environment and a
  separate VPC for a production environment. You can also connect VPCs to other
  networks, such as connecting your VPC to your corporate intranet via a VPN
  connection, so that everyone in your office and all the resources in your AWS
  account can access the same IPs and domain names.

## Configure your deployment

This deployment needs you to provide the following inputs:

```yaml (boilerplate::input)
variables:
  - name: AwsRegion
    description: Into which region should the VPC be deployed?
    type: enum
    default: eu-west-1
    options:
      - us-east-1
      - us-east-2
      - us-west-1
      - eu-west-1
      - ap-southeast-1

  - name: VpcName
    description: What should the VPC be called?
    type: string
    default: my-vpc

  - name: CidrBlock
    description: What should the CIDR block be for the VPC?
    type: string
    default: 10.0.0.0/16

  - name: NumNatGateways
    description: How many NAT Gateways should be deployed in the VPC?
    type: int
    default: 1  
```

## Generate the module

To deploy given the inputs above, you can use the following code in `main.tf`:

```terraform (boilerplate::template: "examples/vpc/main.tf")
provider "aws" {
  region = "{{ .AwsRegion }}"
}

module "vpc" {
  source = "github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog//modules/networking/vpc?ref=v0.3.1"

  vpc_name         = "{{ .VpcName }}"
  cidr_block       = "{{ .CidrBlock }}"
  num_nat_gateways = {{ .NumNatGateways }}
}
```

You may also want to include some useful outputs in `outputs.tf`:

```terraform (boilerplate::template: "examples/vpc/outputs.tf")
output "vpc_id" {
  value = module.vpc.vpc_id
}

output "vpc_name" {
  value = module.vpc.vpc_name
}

output "vpc_cidr_block" {
  value = module.vpc.vpc_cidr_block
}
```

## Generate the tests

And here's an automated test for the generated module:

```go (boilerplate::template: "test/vpc_test.go")
package test

import (
	"testing"
	"github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform"
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/require"
)

func TestVpc(t *testing.T) {
	t.Parallel()

	terraformOptions := &terraform.Options{
		TerraformDir: "../examples/vpc",
	}

	defer terraform.Destroy(t, terraformOptions)
	terraform.InitAndApply(t, terraformOptions)

	vpc_id := terraform.Output(t, terraformOptions, "vpc_id")
	require.Regexp(t, "vpc-.+", vpc_id)

	vpc_name := terraform.Output(t, terraformOptions, "vpc_name")
	require.Equal(t, "{{ .VpcName }}", vpc_name)

	vpc_cidr_block := terraform.Output(t, terraformOptions, "vpc_cidr_block")
	require.Equal(t, "{{ .CidrBlock }}", vpc_cidr_block)	
}
```

You'll also need this `go.mod` file to configure the dependencies:

```go (boilerplate::template: "test/go.mod")
module test

go 1.18

require (
    github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest v0.40.12
)
```

## Run the test

Run the test to make sure the module works as expected:

1. [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (minimum version: 1.18).
2. Authenticate to a test AWS account.
3. Run the tests:

```bash (boilerplate::executable)
cd test
go test -v -timeout 60m
```

## Deploy the module

Now that your deployment is tested, you can deploy by running:

1. Install [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/).
2. Authenticate to a real AWS account.
3. Deploy:

```bash (boilerplate::executable)
cd examples/vpc
terragrunt apply
```
