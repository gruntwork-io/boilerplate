# {{ .Title }}

This is a boilerplate template that shows an example of using recursive dependencies. This template depends on the
[dependencies](/examples/for-learning-and-testing/dependencies) example, which, in turn has its own dependencies. This
template also defines all the variables needed for all dependencies to show how variable inheritance works.
