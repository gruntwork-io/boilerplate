# Recursive dependencies example

This is a boilerplate template that shows an example of using recursive dependencies. This template depends on the
[dependencies](/examples/dependencies) example, which, in turn has its own dependencies. This template also defines
all the variables needed for all dependencies to show how variable inheritance works.
