# Dependencies example

This is a boilerplate template that shows an example of using dependencies. It specifies both the
[docs](/examples/for-learning-and-testing/docs) and [website](/examples/for-learning-and-testing/website) examples as
dependencies to show how one boilerplate template can pull in another. It also defines all the variables needed for both
of those dependencies at the top level to show how variable inheritance works.
